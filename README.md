A small doodle platforming toy. You can draw platforms using your mouse and use arrow keys to jump, move around, and drop down from platforms. Hold down right click to draw speed lines.

You can only jump off of lines, you can't slide off of them. But you maintain your velocity when you move around, allowing you to slide off lines quickly if you jump at the right moment.
